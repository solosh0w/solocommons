Solo Show is always open for submissions.<br>
We welcome offsite exhibitions and other experimental works. <br><br>

We currently have a strong focus on work that:<br>
1. Takes place outside of a gallery setting<br>
2. Is temporary, ephemeral, or viewable only online<br><br>

We prefer files sent via a Google Drive folder with edit permissions for soloshowproject@gmail.com<br>
Please include any titles, text, links, or other information you'd like to publish.<br><br>

We prioritize exhibitions which are previously unpublished (though your project may include old work, presented in a new form or setting).<br>We are always open to curatorial collabs with artists, offspaces and independent initiatives.<br>Open submissions are published at a moderate pace between our curated shows.<br><br>

The nature of your solitude is open to your intepretation.<br><br><br>

Artists are encouraged to familiarize themselves with our visual language before submitting.<br>

An ongoing invitation to shape our Commons is <a href="commonseoi.html">here</a>.
